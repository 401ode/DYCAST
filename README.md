The Dynamic Continuous-Area Space-Time (DYCAST) system is a biologically based spatiotemporal model that uses public reports of dead birds to identify areas at high risk for West Nile virus (WNV) transmission to humans.

The original version was written by Constandinos Theophilides at the [Center for Analysis and Research of Spatial Information (CARSI)](http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/~carsi/) at Hunter College, the City University of New York. That version was written in the Magik programming language for GE SmallWorld GIS. 

The current version was ported to Python and PostGIS by [Alan McConchie](https://github.com/almccon). It is very much a work-in-progress, and some parts of the original system have not been ported yet.

## Requirements

DYCAST has been tested on Microsoft Windows [which versions?] and Mac OS X (versions 10.6 and 10.7). 

DYCAST depends on the following software:

* [PostgreSQL 9.1](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostGIS 2.0](http://postgis.refractions.net/)
* [Python](http://www.python.org/)

For Windows, download and install these requirements from the links provided, following the instructions on the respective web pages. For OS X, we recommend installing the pre-compiled binaries from [William Kyngesburye](http://www.kyngchaos.com/)
